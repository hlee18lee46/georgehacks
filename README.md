### Description
To address patient safety from a consumer-centered approach, this initiative focuses on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and home-based solutions for geriatric patients. By utilizing OpenAI API technology, healthcare solutions can be tailored to each patient, ensuring a patient-centered approach. With the support of an AI assistant, elderly adults will have access to high-speed care, enabling the system to gather critical information about fall accidents and promptly relay it to emergency services and immediate contacts.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** C++, Python, Flask
- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno, HC-06 Bluetooth Module, Tilt Sensor, Buzzer
- **Other Tools:** pyttsx3, pyserial, SpeechRecognition, OpenAI API, SMTP

## Features
- Fall-reconition (Tilt Switch sensor), and button-based emergency alert system using SMS text messages.
- Supports natural conversations using OpenAI LLM.

### Note
To run this program, you need to input your own API key along with your email, password, and respective sms gateways
